# Multiparametric Vital Monitoring Website for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Patients

This project involved the development of a vital monitoring website tailored specifically for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients. The website's primary goal is to facilitate early detection of critical changes in vital signs, enabling healthcare professionals to provide timely and potentially life-saving interventions.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Vital Display**: We have implemented an intuitive and flexible interface that empowers healthcare professionals to customize the displayed vitals according to the unique needs of each TBI patient. This adaptability ensures that the monitoring system remains highly relevant and effective for different cases.

- **Real-time Vital Monitoring**: The website offers real-time monitoring of vital signs, providing healthcare professionals with up-to-the-minute data to support informed decision-making.

- **User-friendly UI/UX Design**: The frontend of the website was built using React with Typescript, and its UI/UX design was carefully crafted using Figma. This focus on user experience ensures that healthcare professionals can efficiently access and interpret vital information.

- **API Integration with Django REST**: We used Django REST to create APIs that seamlessly communicate with the database. This integration guarantees data accuracy and accessibility, allowing healthcare professionals to access patient records efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Typescript was employed to build the frontend of the website, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface.

- **UI/UX Design**: Figma was utilized to design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that enhances user experience.

- **Backend**: Django REST was chosen as the backend framework for its robust capabilities in creating APIs and managing data.
